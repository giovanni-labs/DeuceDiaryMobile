# ASO Recommendations — Deuce Diary

## Recommended App Title & Subtitle

### Option A (Recommended)
- **Title:** `Deuce Diary: Poop Tracker`
- **Subtitle:** `Social Bowel Log with Streaks`

**Why:** "Poop Tracker" is the #1 search term in this category. Having it in the title gives maximum weight for App Store search ranking. The subtitle captures the social + streak differentiators and includes "bowel log" for medical-intent searches.

### Option B (Social-Forward)
- **Title:** `Deuce Diary: Social Poop Tracker`
- **Subtitle:** `Log Bowel Movements with Friends`

**Why:** Leads with the unique social angle. "Social Poop Tracker" is a low-competition long-tail keyword that nobody else owns. Subtitle adds "bowel movements" for health-intent queries.

### Option C (Health-Forward)
- **Title:** `Deuce Diary: Poop & Gut Tracker`
- **Subtitle:** `Social Streaks & Bowel Health`

**Why:** Captures both "poop tracker" and "gut tracker" high-value terms. Better for health-intent users searching for IBS/gut health solutions.

## App Store Category
- **Primary:** Health & Fitness
- **Secondary:** Social Networking

**Rationale:** Poop Map dominates Entertainment → Social Networking. By positioning in Health & Fitness, Deuce Diary avoids direct category competition with the 62K-review gorilla while gaining credibility with health-intent searchers. The secondary Social Networking category still surfaces the app in social searches.

### Keyword Priority Reasoning

| Keyword | In Title? | In Keywords? | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| poop | ✅ Title | — | Highest search volume, no need to duplicate |
| tracker | ✅ Title | — | Combined with "poop" in title |
| diary | ✅ Title (brand) | — | Brand name covers it |
| bowel movement | ❌ | ✅ | Medical-intent searches, high relevance |
| stool log | ❌ | ✅ | Alternative medical term + "log" action |
| gut health | ❌ | ✅ | Broader health audience capture |
| streak | ❌ | ✅ | Unique differentiator, habit tracker overlap |
| poop diary | ❌ | ✅ | Direct category term |
| IBS | ❌ | ✅ | Medical condition, 10-15% of population |
| Bristol scale | ❌ | ✅ | Medical credibility, doctor-recommended |
| social | ❌ | ✅ | Social app searches |
| squad | ❌ | ✅ | Unique to DD, group/team searches |

**Note:** Apple's algorithm combines words across title, subtitle, and keywords. "Poop" in title + "diary" in keywords = "poop diary" match. Don't waste keyword characters repeating title words.

## Screenshot Recommendations (for future)

1. **Hero shot:** Streak counter + rank badge (Porcelain Royalty) — "Build Your Streak"
2. **Social feed:** Squad reactions and activity — "Track Together"
3. **Leaderboard:** Live rankings with friends — "Compete with Friends"
4. **Weekly report:** Throne Report card — "Weekly Insights"
5. **Quick log:** 1-tap logging animation — "Log in Seconds"
6. **Premium:** Themes and gold badge — "Go Premium"

**Tone:** Fun, colorful, show real UI. Avoid clinical/boring. Show social proof (friends, reactions). Use humor in captions.

## Competitive Positioning Summary

| vs Competitor | Deuce Diary Wedge |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Poop Map** (62K reviews) | Health insights they don't have. Bristol Scale, trends, weekly reports. They're Entertainment; we're Health. |
| **Cara Care** (4.5K reviews) | Fun + social they don't have. Not clinical, not overwhelming. Tracking you'll actually do. |
| **Happy Poop** (2K reviews) | Better UX, better social execution, streak mechanics. Their social features are a ghost town. |
| **Poopie** (1K reviews) | Deeper health tracking, better gamification, larger squad mechanics. |
| **iPoop** (203 reviews) | Everything they do, executed better and at scale. |
