The Strava of poop tracking — finally, a bowel movement tracker that's social, fun, AND actually useful.

Deuce Diary turns your daily bathroom routine into a streak-powered social experience. Track your poops, build unstoppable streaks, compete with friends, and actually understand your gut health — all without the clinical boredom of medical apps or the gimmicky emptiness of novelty ones.

WHY DEUCE DIARY?
Most poop trackers are either too medical (hello, 47-field symptom forms) or too silly (pin a poop on a map and… that's it). Deuce Diary is the first app that combines real health insights with the social accountability that makes you actually stick with it.

🔥 STREAKS THAT STICK
Build your daily deuce streak and watch your rank climb from Peasant to Porcelain Royalty. Miss a day? It resets. That simple pressure keeps you logging — and logging means tracking, and tracking means better gut health awareness. Duolingo energy, bathroom edition.

👥 SQUADS — YOUR POOP CREW
Create or join a squad with friends, family, or your group chat. See who's keeping up, who's slacking, and celebrate milestones together. Group streaks keep everyone honest.

🏆 LIVE LEADERBOARDS
Who dropped the most deuces this week? Every squad has a real-time leaderboard ranked by contributions. Friendly competition has never been this… regular.

📊 WEEKLY THRONE REPORT
Get your personalized weekly summary — how you performed, your streak status, and how you stack up against the squad. Share it or screenshot it. Either way, it's bragging rights.

⚡ LOG IN SECONDS
No friction, no 10-field forms. Open, tap, done. The fastest poop logging experience on the App Store — because nobody wants to spend MORE time in the bathroom.

😂 REACTIONS & SOCIAL FEED
React to your squad's entries with emojis. Hype up a friend's streak milestone. Roast someone who broke theirs. It's a social feed, but for your bowel movements.

🔒 PRIVACY FIRST
Your entries are yours. Share with your squad or keep them completely private. Granular privacy controls mean you choose exactly what's visible. No location tracking, no data selling, no surprises.

👑 PORCELAIN PREMIUM
